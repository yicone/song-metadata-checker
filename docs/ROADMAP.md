## Known Limitations

### Current Constraints

#### 1. **Unofficial API Dependencies**

**Issue**: NeteaseCloudMusicApi and QQ Music API are community-maintained, unofficial APIs.

**Impact**:

- APIs may break without notice
- Rate limiting and stability issues
- No official support or SLA

**Workaround**:

- Monitor API health regularly using `scripts/validate_apis.py`
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Consider caching frequently accessed data

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Ongoing Risk

---

#### 2. **Limited Error Recovery**

**Issue**: Current workflow has basic error handling but limited automatic recovery.

**Impact**:

- Failed API calls may require manual intervention
- No automatic retry mechanism for transient failures
- Limited graceful degradation

**Workaround**:

- Manual retry through Dify interface
- Check logs for specific error details

**Status**: üîß Planned for v0.2.0

---

#### 3. **No Caching Mechanism**

**Issue**: Every request fetches fresh data from APIs.

**Impact**:

- Slower response times for repeated queries
- Higher API usage and potential rate limiting
- Unnecessary load on external services

**Workaround**:

- Avoid querying the same song multiple times
- Use local notes for frequently checked songs

**Status**: üîß Planned for v0.3.0

---

#### 4. **Single Language Support**

**Issue**: System primarily designed for Chinese music platforms.

**Impact**:

- Limited effectiveness for non-Chinese music
- OCR may struggle with non-Chinese text
- Search algorithms optimized for Chinese characters

**Workaround**:

- Spotify API provides better coverage for international music
- Manual verification for non-Chinese content

**Status**: üìã Under Consideration

---

#### 5. **Manual Dify Configuration**

**Issue**: Workflow requires manual import and configuration in Dify.

**Impact**:

- Setup complexity for new users
- Environment variables must be configured manually
- No automated deployment process

**Workaround**:

- Follow detailed deployment guide
- Use provided `.env.example` template

**Status**: üîß Planned for v0.4.0
